.SH NAME
.B _printf \- formatted output conversion
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <holberton.h>

.B int _printf(const char *format, ...);
.SH DESCRIPTION
The functions in the printf() family produce output according to a format as described below.
.SH OPTIONS
Upon successful return, the function returns the number of characters printed (excluding the null byte used to end output to strings).
If an output error is encountered, a negative value is returned.
.SH Format of the format string
The format string is a character string, beginning and ending in its initial shift state, if any. The format string is composed of zero or more directives: ordinary characters (not %), which are copied unchanged to the output stream; and conversion specifications, each of which results in fetching zero or more subsequent arguments. Each conversion specification is introduced by the character %, and ends with a conversion specifier. In between there may be (in this order) zero or more flags, an optional minimum field width, an optional precision and an optional length modifier.
The arguments must correspond properly (after type promotion) with the conversion specifier. By default, the arguments are used in the order given, where each '*' and each conversion specifier asks for the next argument (and it is an error if insufficiently many arguments are given). One can also specify explicitly which argument is taken, at each place where an argument is required, by writing "%m$" instead of '%' and "*m$" instead of '*', where the decimal integer m denotes the position in the argument list of the desired argument, indexed starting from 1. Thus,

printf("%*d", width, num);
and
printf("%2$*1$d", width, num);
are equivalent. The second style allows repeated references to the same argument. The C99 standard does not include the style using '$', which comes from the Single UNIX Specification. If the style using '$' is used, it must be used throughout for all conversions taking an argument and all width and precision arguments, but it may be mixed with "%%" formats which do not consume an argument. There may be no gaps in the numbers of arguments specified using '$'; for example, if arguments 1 and 3 are specified, argument 2 must also be specified somewhere in the format string.
.SH USAGE
.I_printf("Character:[%c]\n", 'H');
Character:[H]
.TP
.I_printf("Length:[%d, %i]\n", len, len);
Length:[39, 39]
.SH RETURN VALUE
Upon successful return, these functions return the number of characters printed (excluding the null byte used to end output to strings).
